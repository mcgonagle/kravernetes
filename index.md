### History of Krav Maga

Krav Maga is a military self-defence and fighting system developed for the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and Israeli security forces derived from a combination of techniques sourced from Boxing, Wrestling, Judo, Aikido, and Karate. Krav Maga is known for its focus on real-world situations and its extreme efficiency. It was derived from the street-fighting experience of Hungarian-Israeli martial artist Imi Lichtenfeld, who made use of his training as a boxer and wrestler, while defending the Jewish quarter against fascist groups in Bratislava, Czechoslovakia, during the mid-to-late 1930s. In the late 1940s, after his aliyah to Mandatory Palestine, he began to provide lessons on combat training to what was to become the IDF.

**Krav Maga has a philosophy emphasizing aggression, and simultaneous defensive and offensive maneuvers.** 

Some of the key focus is instinctive response under stress. To that end, Krav Maga is an eclectic system that has not sought to replace existing effective techniques, taking what is useful from available systems, for example:

    * Strikes – as per karate, and boxing,
    * Take-downs and throws – per judo, aikido and wrestling
    * Ground work – per judo and wrestling
    * Escapes from chokes and holds – per judo, aikido, wrestling
    * Empty-hand weapon defenses – per aikido

### DevSecOps
The purpose of *DevSecOps* is to integrate security controls and processes into the DevOps software development cycle, a process which is achieved by promoting the collaboration between security teams, development teams and operations teams.

Kraverenetes is a practical *DevSecOps* methodology which focuses on the four pillars of Krav Maga, which are:

    1. awareness
    2. avoidance
    3. de-escalation and escape
    4. last-resort decisive, simultaneous attack and defense

### Situational Awareness = Mindfullness
Situation awareness has been recognized as a critical, yet often elusive, foundation for successful decision-making across a broad range of situations, many of which involve the protection of human life and property, including law enforcement, aviation, air traffic control, ship navigation, health care, emergency response, military command and control operations, self defense, and offshore oil and nuclear power plant management. Lacking or inadequate situation awareness has been identified as one of the primary factors in accidents attributed to human error.

### Retzev - "Continuous Motion"

**Retzev is a concept that urges the Krav Maga practitioner to utilize and harness the natural power in movement throughout both defensive and offensive initiatives within a self-defense technique(s).**

### "Practice, Practice, Practice"

“Kubernetes only provides the API, Orchestration and Scheduling and resource management. To get a complete application platform you also need a Linux Operating System; a container registry; container networking; container storage, logging, monitoring and method to integrate CI/CD pipelines.”

### So how can we strengthen the Kubernetes security?

    1. By reducing the Kubernetes attack surface:
         Check for vulnerabilities periodically
         Review audit logs
         Review network policies and pod security policies
         Review Kubernetes secrets
    3. By utilizing inbuilt Kubernetes platform security features
         Authenticiation and Authroization
         Audit Logging
         Network Logging
         Pod Security
         Secrets Management
    5. By using open source tools for Kubernetes security
         TUF
         Clair
         Kube-bench
         Kubesec
         Kubeaudit
